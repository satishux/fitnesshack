All Rewriters allows you to use all of the most popular rewriting softwares in your Wordpress weblog to quickly spin the articles you are working on.

== Description ==

All Rewriters integrates several APIs of the most popular spinning applications into your Wordpress blog, allowing you to use any or all of them to easily spin articles in your WP editor and then preview, compare and apply the results. Currently All Rewriters supports TheBestSpinner, SpinRewriter, ChimpRewriter, WordAI, Contentprofessor and SpinnerChief.

After installation you will find a new meta box on the Wordpress "Add New" screens that will allow you to spin the article you are currently working on through any of your enabled rewriting software APIs with a single click, preview the spun article, compare it to the results of other rewriters and finally copy the spun version back to the editor if the result is satisfactory.

Please note that to use All Rewriters you need to have an account with at least one of the supported rewriters.
